# System Programming code for learning WINAPI
This project was built in university to learn more about system programming on windows and the usage of Windows API.
This app takes the 'bensound-far.mp3' file and manipulates its ID3 tag (song name, author, album name) by using WINAPI. This app works on all mp3 files.
